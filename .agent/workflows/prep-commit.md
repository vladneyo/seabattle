description: Prepare commit
---

1. Verify local changes with build-verify.md workflow. Proceed only if this step succeeded. Otherwise fix the errors and warnings and then proceed.
2. Look through local changes, recent prompt history, your walkthrough artifact, docs changes and prepare commit with relevant correct and concise summary.
3. Do commit, don't push.
